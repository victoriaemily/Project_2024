# CSCE 435 Group project

## 0. Group number: 

## 1. Group members:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third
4. Fourth

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

For example:
- Algorithm 1
- Algorithm 2
- Algorithm 3
- Algorithm 4

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
