        1. Initialize MPI - MPI_Init()

        2. Rank and size of MPI COMM_WORLD
            a. MPI_Comm_rank, MPI_Comm_size
        3. If rank == 0 then: read in the input array, split the input array into the number of processes part
            a. Use a fixed array for sorting so it is the same across all different types of sorting 
            b. no variable is our size of array 
        4. Broadcast that size of array to all the processes using MPI_Bcast
            a. MPI_Bcast(no, 1, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD)
        5. Find the size of each subarray for each of the process: subSize = no  / world size (from mpi_comm_size)
        6. Allocate a memory for each process’s subarray with subSize
        7. Scatter the original array into all the subarrays
            a. MPI_Scatter()
        8. Allocate temp array for merging with subSize
        9. Every process will perform merge sort on its own subarray 
            a. mergeSort(subarray, temparray, 0, subSize-1)
        10. Root process - gathers all the sorted subarrays 
            a. World rank is 0, we want to make a sorted array with the size of the array (no)
        11. Perform MPI_Gather to grab all the sorted subarrays from all the processes 
        12. Final merge with the root process so world rank is 0, create another array with the no variable size and use mergeSort function
        13. Add a print statement that prints out the sorted array to check 
        14. Free any memory and finalize the MPI environment: MPI_Finalize()


    Merge Function: * merge two sorted halves of one array into a complete sorted single array*
        1. Set lh= to the start index to the left half, set i= to the start index for the temporary array (temp array), 
            set rh= to the starting index of the right half (ending index of the first half + 1)
        2. While loop to start merging and compare the elements in both halves: * loop will finish after one half is processed* -&gt; 
            While (lh &lt;= ending index of first half &amp;&amp; rh &lt;= ending index of that array portion needed to sort)
                a. If current element array[lh] is &lt;= to the current element in the right half so array[rh] we want to copy the array[lh] into the temp array at i and then increment the lh and the i
                b. Else we want to do the opposite so array[rh] to temp array at i and increment the rh and the i
        3. Remaining elements will be copied:
            a. If there are elements in the right half leftover or the left it will be copied into the temp array 
            b. Check the index and the end of side index to see if one side has been fully processed or not 
        4. Copy the sorted elements from the temp array all back to the original array
            a. using a for loop and the indexes 

    MergeSort Function: *recursive merge sort algorithm without impacting any MPI*
        1. Check if the starting index is less than the ending index of the array -&gt; if LI &lt; RI -&gt; want to make sure the array 
            has more than one element
                a. Find the middle index: mid = (LI + RI) / 2, average of left and right index divided by 2
                b. Recursively call mergeSort so it can sort the left half -&gt; LI to mid, left index to mid index 
                c. Recursively call mergeSort so it can sort the right half -&gt; mid+1, RI, mid+1 index to right index
                d. Merge Function called so we can combine it into a single sorted array

<ul>
<li>Input sizes: 2^16, 2^18, 2^20, 2^22, 2^24, 2^26, 2^28</li>
<li>Input types: Sorted, Random, Reverse sorted, 1% perturbed</li>
<li>Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)</li>
<li>Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)</li>
<li>For number of processors: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024</li>
</ul>
<p>For each algorithm (Bitonic Sort, Sample Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort), the following metrics will be measured:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Execution Time</strong>: Track the time required to complete the sort for various input sizes, input types, and processor counts.</li>
<li><strong>Speedup</strong>: Compare the parallel execution time with the sequential baseline to assess the improvement for each algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Determine how effectively each algorithm uses additional processors by calculating speedup divided by the number of processors.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="strong-scaling">Strong Scaling:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: Analyze how each algorithm performs as the number of processors increases while keeping the input size constant.</li>
<li><strong>Method</strong>: For a fixed input size (e.g., 2^24 elements), run the algorithm with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and more processors. We will measure execution time and calculate speedup and efficiency for each case.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison</strong>: Evaluate how each algorithm’s execution time changes with different processor counts.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="weak-scaling">Weak Scaling:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Evaluate how well each algorithm handles increasing input sizes as the number of processors grows proportionally, while ensuring each processor has sufficient work to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Method</strong>: For each input type (Sorted, Random, Reverse Sorted, 1% Perturbed), we will start with a small input size and a reasonable number of processors. As we increase the input size, we plan to proportionally increase the number of processors:</p>
<ul>
<li>2^16 elements for 2 processors</li>
<li>2^18 elements for 4 processors</li>
<li>2^20 elements for 8 processors</li>
<li>2^22 elements for 16 processors</li>
<li>2^24 elements for 32 processors</li>
<li>2^26 elements for 64 processors</li>
<li>2^28 elements for 128 processors</li>
<li>2^28 elements for 256 processors</li>
<li>2^28 elements for 512 processors</li>
<li>2^28 elements for 1024 processors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comparison</strong>: Measure the execution time for each combination of input size and processor count. The goal is to maintain a stable execution time as both the input size and the number of processors increase, showing strong weak scaling properties.</p>

<p>Required region annotations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>main</code> - top-level main function.
<ul>
<li><code>data_init_X</code> - the function where input data is generated or read in from file. Use <em>data_init_runtime</em> if you are generating the data during the program, and <em>data_init_io</em> if you are reading the data from a file.</li>
<li><code>correctness_check</code> - function for checking the correctness of the algorithm output (e.g., checking if the resulting data is sorted).</li>
<li><code>comm</code> - All communication-related functions in your algorithm should be nested under the <code>comm</code> region.
<ul>
<li>Inside the <code>comm</code> region, you should create regions to indicate how much data you are communicating (i.e., <code>comm_small</code> if you are sending or broadcasting a few values, <code>comm_large</code> if you are sending all of your local values).</li>

        - Creates a vector called data
        - Through a for loop from index 0 to inputted_size

        - Creates a vector called data.
        - Through a for loop adds values from inputted size - 1 to 0

    6. std::vector&lt;int&gt; generateRandomInput(int size, const std::string&amp; input_type)
        - Uses the given input_type to decide which generation function to use.
        - Calls data generation function based on input_type. 
          If the input_type = &quot;Random&quot;, it will call generateRandomData(int size).
    
    Main Function:

    1. Initalize MPI
        The algorithm starts by initializing the MPI environment 
        using MPI_Init and setting up task ids for each process 
        and the total number of processors (num_tasks).
        Adiak is then initialized to collect metadata about the execution environment.

    2. Set variables from job script arguments 
        The input parameters passed to the program are extracted:
            input_size: Total number of elements in the array to be sorted.
            num_tasks: Number of processors.
            input_type: The type of data input (sorted, random, etc.).
    
    3. Ensure there are at least two processors
        If statement to make sure num_tasks is at least 2. If not,
        then the program will abort. 

    4. Adiak collects various data about the program 
        This includes algorithm, input_type, etc. 

    5. Generate data for sorting 
        We start off by marking the region of init with caliper for timing.
        A vector for local_data is created to generate an array based 
        off of the input type. Each processor will receive a certain 
        size of data to generate. This will be evenly divided. 
        For example, if there are 8 processors, each processor 
        generates input_size / 8 elements based on the specified input_type.
    
    6. Sort local data 
        Each processor will sort the data that it created.
        This will once again be timed by caliper but 
        it will be noted as a small computation since we 
        are only sorting local data and not the whole array.
    
    7. Drawing sample size 
        Each processor will draw a sample size to determine how many values to sample.
        The size s is computed as the logarithm of the number of local data 
        elements (log2(local_data.size())). The purpose of this is to reduce
        communication overhead by ensuring that the sample size will be more consistent
        to the size of the data. Based on this sample size, each processor will 
        randomly pick s samples from its data. 
    
    8. Gathering samples 
        All processors send their local samples to a designated root process 
        using MPI_Gather. MPI_Gather will collect the samples from all 
        processors and send them to a designated root processor. 
        The root processor receives all the samples and will combine
        them into a single array. This process will be marked and timed
        as a small communication by caliper. 
    
    9. Sample Sorting and Splitting 
        The root process now sorts the samples. It then selects num_tasks - 1 splitters 
        from the sorted samples, which will be used to partition the data 
        into buckets across all processors. Therefore the number of buckets and 
        the number of processors should be equivalent. The formula s * (i + 1) is used
        to secure indices ensuring a good distance that efficiently partions the data.
        The splitters are then broadcast to all processors using MPI_Bcast. 
        This ensures that every processor knows the ranges of each bucket. Sorting
        the samples is marked and timed as a small computation by caliper, while the 
        Bcast function will be marked and timed as a small communication. 

    10. Putting data into buckets 
         We create a 2D vector, buckets, where each inner vector represents a bucket. 
         The number of buckets is equal to the number of processors. 
         Each processor has its own bucket where data will be partitioned. 
         Each inner vector (buckets[i]) holds the values that will
         be sent to processor i during the data exchange phase. The code iterates 
         over each value in the local data. Each value will be placed into one of the buckets 
         based on the splitters. This loop goes through each splitter 
         to determine where the current value should be placed. The loop checks if the value 
         is less than or equal to the current splitter. If less, the bucket index 
         is set to i, meaning the value belongs in the bucket for that splitter. 
         The loop then breaks as the correct bucket is found. If the value is 
         greater than the current splitter, the code moves on to 
         check the next splitter and increments.

    1l. Assigning buckets to processors 
         We then initialize our counts. We will use these
         to assign sizes of each buckets to sendcounts to tell MPI
         how much each processor will be sending to other processors
         and receiving from other processors. Using all to all, we 
         send these values to all of the processors. Next we 
         calculate the total size of data the current processor will receive
         by summing up all elements in recvcounts and initialize
         recvbuf to hold the data. The send_index and 
         receive_index arrays are then set up to indicate the starting positions 
         for sending and receiving data in the buffers for each processor. 
         We then convert the 2D buckets vector into a single sendbuf 
         vector so that it can be processed by MPI, enabling each processor 
         to send its data to the appropriate destination.

    12. Sending data to buckets and sorting data 
         Using MPI_Alltoallv, each processor sends its data in each bucket 
         to the appropriate processors. This and steps 10-11 are marked as a 
         large communication and timed by caliper. We then mark a large computation
         to time the sorting of all arrays by the processors. After receiving the 
         partitioned data, each processor sorts the received data locally.

    13. Correctness Check
         After sorting is completed, the alorithm checks if the locally

<li>Merge Sort Algorithm:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>	Sorting Functions:
	1. void merge(int *arr1, int *arr2, int LI, int mid, int RI):
		- This function allows for combination of two sorted subarrays into one sorted array.
		- It takes the left index, midpoint, right index to find the boundaries of each subarray within the original array.
		- As we go through each of the index for the left or right, we check if either the left or the right value in the each subarray is smaller before deciding which to copy into the temporary array.
		- If we have any leftover elements after the indexes are hit their respective conditions, it will copy those to the temporary array which is arr2 in this case.
		- Following the subarray sorting, the temporary array will be copied into arr1.
	2. void mergeSort(int *arr1, int *arr2, int LI, int RI):
		- This function will recursively divide the array into smaller subarrays before sorting them and merging them back sorted.
		- As long as the left index is less than the right index  which makes sure it has enough elements to sort (at least 2 elements), we would need to find the middle point.
		- This leads to the recursive call of mergeSort which allows it to keep dividing up the subarray for both left and the right sides in the subarray.
		- After the dividing is complete, the merging will take place where it will call the above merge function to merge the subarrays in a sorted manner.

	Main Function:
	1. Initialize MPI/Adiak
		- Begin by initializing the MPI environment and retrieving the rank of the current process with taskid as well as the total number of processes with numtasks
		- Initialize Adiak as well for performance monitoring and logging as well as to collect metadata 
	2. Input Validation
		- Ensure that there is three command-line arguments.
	3. Declare and Initialize Variables:
		- Read and convert the command-line arguments into its respective variables.
		- These arguments are the array size, number of processes, and the input type.
		- Make sure there are at least 2 MPI processes running in the program as the program needs multiple processes to distribute work.
	4. Collect Data with Adiak:
		- Collect the needed information with Adiak: algorithm, programming model, data type…
	5. Array Allocation:
		- Allocate memory for the original array based on the given input size in preparation for the population of the array 
	6. Array Population with Input Type:
		- Populate the original array with the input types: sorted, random, reverse, 1%perturbed.
		- Sorted: provide a basic sorted array based on the size of the array
		- Random: randomly generate numbers for the array
		- Reverse: provide a basic reversed array based on the size of the array
		- 1%perturbed: randomly select a few values and determine the amount of swaps 
		* this also marks the end of data initialization
	7. Subarray Size and Memory:
		- Determine each subarray size for process distribution
		- Allocate memory for the subarray to be able to hold data for the current process
	8. Scatter
		- Start tracking comm and comm_large performance
		- Use a barrier to synchronize all the processes in the communicator
		- Distribute subarrays from the original array to each of the processes
	9. Merge Sort
		- Start tracking comp and comp_large performance
		- Allocate a temporary memory for the tempArray that will be used for sorting in each process.
		- Call the mergeSort function to sort that subArray
	10. Allocate memory for final merge:
		- Create a pointer to be used for the final sorted array 
		- In the master process, we want to allocate memory for the final sorted array
	11. Gather:
		- Start tracking comm and comm_large performance
		- Use MPI_Gather to collect all the sorted subarrays from all the processes into the master process.
	12. Final Merge:
		- Make sure its all the master process before allocating another temporary memory for the new temporary array that will be used in the mergeSort process for the final sorting.
		- Start tracking comp and comp_large performance
		- Call the mergeSort function for the sorting of the final array
	13. Correctness Check:
		- Start correctness_check to measure performance
		- Use a boolean to check if its sorted with the is_sorted function. 
		- If the boolean is true then it has been sorted and will output into the file that “The data is sorted”. 
	14. Finalize and Cleanup
		- Free all memory allocated areas
	 	- Call MPI_Finalize() to finalize the MPI environment, finishing the program.

<p>Bitonic Sort Algorithm:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>Helper Functions:
1. quicksort(std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; arr): Uses standard library's std::sort to sort a given vector of integers.
2. generateSortedData(int size): Generates a sorted vector of integers from 0 to size - 1 using a for loop.
3. generatePerturbedData(int size): Starts by creating a sorted vector. Then randomly swaps 1% of its elements to perturb the array.
4. generateRandomData(int size): Produces a vector of random integers, each ranging from 0 to size - 1.
5. generateReverseSortedData(int size): Generates a reverse-sorted vector of integers.
6. generateRandomInput(int size, const std::string&amp; input_type): A function that calls the appropriate data generation method (random, sorted, perturbed, reversed) based on the user-specified input type. Or throws error if input type not valid.

Sorting Functions:
1. compare_and_swap(std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; data, int i, int j, bool ascending): Compares two elements and swaps them if they are not in the correct order (specified by ascending).
2. bitonic_merge(std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; data, int low, int cnt, bool ascending): This function merges two halves of a bitonic sequence by comparing and swapping elements based on the ascending flag. It first divides the sequence, performs comparisons, and recursively merges the subsequences until the sequence is fully sorted when cnt &lt;= 1.
3. bitonic_sort(std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; data, int low, int cnt, bool ascending): This function recursively divides the data into two subsequences: one sorted in ascending order and the other in descending order. It then uses bitonic_merge to combine them into a fully sorted sequence, continuing until the entire array is sorted.

Main Function:
1. MPI Initialization: We use MPI_Init to start MPI, MPI_Comm_rank for the process ID, and MPI_Comm_size to find the number of processes.
2. Metadata Collection: adiak statements – init, launchdate, libraries, cmdline, clustername – that will collect metadata from this algorithm.
3. Input Handling: Handles command line arguments passed to the program – input_size, num_tasks, input_type. Also aborts if number of processors is less than 2.
4. Metadata Collection: adiak statements – algorithm . . . implementation_source – that will collect metadata from this algorithm.
5. Local Data Distribution: Using the generateRandomInput function, each process receives a segment of the total array that they will have to sort locally. The type of data will be according to the specified input type (random, sorted, perturbed, reversed).
6. Local On Each Process: Sort each array with quicksort helper function.
7. MPI Gather: Part of comm, it collects the locally sorted data from all processes and gathers it into the root process (task 0).
8. Global Sorting: The root process performs the final bitonic sort on the globally collected data. The entire dataset is now sorted using the bitonic algorithm.
9. Correctness Check: Verifies that the sorted data is correctly ordered using std::is_sorted(). Checked by root process.
10. MPI Finalize: Cleans up and shuts down the MPI environment after program completion.

<p>Radix Sort</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>Initialization:
MPI is initialized, and process ranks are retrieved.
Metadata about the run is recorded using Adiak.

Input Generation:
Each process generates a portion of the input data based on the user-specified input type (Sorted, Random, etc.).

generateSortedData(size): Generates an array of integers in ascending order from 0 to size-1.
generatePerturbedData(size): Perturbs the sorted array by randomly swapping 1% of its elements.
generateRandomData(size): Generates an array of random integers.
generateReverseSortedData(size): Generates an array of integers in descending order.

Radix Sort Setup
Bits per Pass: The program calculates how many bits are processed in each pass of Radix Sort. This is determined by the number of processes (num_tasks) and the available bits per integer (assumed to be 32 bits).
Radix: The number of &quot;bins&quot; or buckets is determined by shifting 1 by the number of bits per pass.
Total Passes: The number of passes required for sorting is calculated based on the bit width of integers.


Parallel Radix Sort:
Radix Sort is performed in parallel. Each process calculates the bits to sort and exchanges data with other processes during each pass.

The program runs Radix Sort in parallel across multiple MPI processes.
Loop Through Radix Passes: For each pass:
Computation Phase (CALI_MARK_BEGIN(&quot;comp_small&quot;)):
Each process determines which &quot;bucket&quot; or range of values each of its elements belongs to based on the current bit pass.
Data is organized into local buckets, with each bucket targeting a specific MPI process.
Communication Phase:
Processes exchange data with one another to ensure that all elements destined for a particular process are sent to the correct destination.
MPI_Alltoall() is used to exchange the number of elements each process will send/receive.
MPI_Alltoallv() is used to exchange the actual data between processes.
Local Data Update: After receiving data from other processes, each process updates its local data with the newly received elements.

Correctness Verification:
After sorting, each process verifies that its data is sorted.

Profiling and Metadata:
The algorithm is profiled using Caliper to measure computation and communication times. Metadata about the algorithm is also recorded using Adiak.

Finalization:
MPI is finalized, and the program terminates.

<p>The plot shows that for a very large input size, increasing the number of processes initially reduces computation time significantly, but beyond 100-200 processes, the benefits taper off. This is likely due to communication and synchronization overheads, which will start to outweigh the advantages of adding more processors. Past this point, performance stabilizes or worsens (but very slightly), indicating that further increases in the number of processors offer diminishing returns. The different input types show similar performance patterns, suggesting that for large inputs, the sorting state of the data doesn't really impact scalability.</p>

<p>Overall:
For smaller input sizes, the time remains relatively stable as the number of processes increases, indicating good scalability. However, for the larger input sizes (like 67108864 and 268435456), there is an initial spike in execution time, which then declines as the number of processes increases. This suggests while smaller input sizes scale efficiently, larger input sizes face more significant overhead at least initially, likely due to communication and synchronization costs. As more processes are added, this overhead reduces, though the larger inputs still take longer to process compared to smaller ones.</p>
<p>The trend persists across the different input types.</p>

<p>Strong Scaling Plot for 2^16:</p>
  <p align="left">
  <img width="604" alt="StrongScaling2^16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62472b93-08cc-466a-b1c3-aa06c140ed43">
</p>
  	Generally, looking at the smallest input size of 2^16 for strong scaling, the performance seems to decrease in strong scaling efficiency as the number of processors increase. The performance seems to spike at around 400 		processors specifically for sorted input which could be due to some inefficiency or anomalies in the communication or workload distribution. After 400 processors, the performance does improve with a downward trend before 		leveling out. As the problem size is small, dividing it across a large number of processors (after 400) could mean that each process is handling a small amount of work. Thus, creating a situation where communciation and 		synchronization overhead will dominate. For the other input types, the random, reverse, and perturbed seem to have a more gradual scaling but also starts to degrade as the number of processors increase, specifically after 		around 200 processors as the time starts to rise quite steadily. Especially for small input sizes, the amount of work per process is relatively limited which dominates the synchronization costs. There could be a high 		synchronization overhead due to many processors working on the small problem. Also in the merging phase, the processors could need to wait for one another which could create larger times due to the smaller input size.
<p> </p>
<p>Strong Scaling Plot for 2^22:</p>
  <p align="left">
  <img width="604" alt="StrongScaling2^22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c891af4d-7b03-48c1-a36f-f0ba3ed69df2">
</p>
  	This graph contains the strong scaling for the input size of 2^22. Here, the degradation is more subtle than the 2^16 graph with the performance being stabilized after 200 processors. There are initial spikes before 200 		processors. However, even after the spikes, there is still a general increase as more processors are added which suggests that there could be more communication overhead. Synchronization could also be a issue when 			introducing more processors because the synchronization between the processors will add an layer of overhead. With more processors, the merging phase requires the processors to exchange their results and ensures that the 		merges are done in a specific order which will increase communication and synchronization costs.  Specifically for random input in processors before 200, there is instability being shown. The spikes should suggest that 		communication or data partitioning was inefficient and even after flattening out, the system does not gain much more speedup as the increasing amount of processors may add more overhead than what is saved in computation 		time. Moreover, the random input type data could be higher due to the load imbalances that are caused by the unpredictable nature of random data which could also make it harder to distribute the workload more evenly.
<p> </p>
<p>Strong Scaling Plot for 2^28:</p>

</p>
	This graph contains the strong scaling for the input size of 2^28. Here, there is less degradation as the larger input size allows for each process to handle more work so communication and computation ratio should be good. 		However, there seems to still be instability specifically at the spike before 200 processors especially for random input data which could be due to the unpredictable nature of random data. Even with improvement, after 200 		processors the trend starts to become constant which could mean that the synchronization costs start to outweigh the computational benefits of adding more processors. Therefore, additional processors do not significantly 		reduce overall time as they could be waiting on one another specifically in the merge phase.

<p>Strong Scaling Speedup for 1%Perturbed:
<p align="left">
<img width="604" alt="StrongScalingSpeedupPerturbed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d971a693-3ea3-41fe-a795-57fdaf149f88"></p>
  <p></p>
  	This graph is describing the strong scaling speedup for the 1% perturbed imput type. For the smaller processors, it seems that the speedup is a lot higher. The speedup seems to start off at 6 for the smallest input size 		which 	suggests that the parallelization should be working fine initially. Merge sort should be able to provide a substantial speedup early on when the input size is small and division of work is efficient. However after 		around 100 processors, the speedup starts to flatten out or degrade for all the input sizes, hovering at around 1.5 and 2 speedup for the larger input sizes. For the smaller input sizes, the speedup does drop quite sharply 		because the work per process becomes very small so synchronization/communication overhead can begin to dominate the runtime. In the larger input sizes, the speedup does remain quite constant at around 2 as the number of 		processors increase. This should suggest that there is pretty good speedup at the larger inputs. The flattening out of speedup could be because of the synchronization costs during the merging for merge sort. With the 		increase in input size, each merge should require more and more synchronization between processors, which could limit further speedup.
<p> </p>
<p>Strong Scaling Speedup for Random:</p>
  <p align="left">
  <img width="604" alt="StrongScalingSpeedupRandom" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0734c6a-8b41-44ef-a043-a890d09f7a49">
</p>
  	For this strong scaling speedup graph, the input type used is random and we see that it behaves quite similarly to the perturbed input graph, where the smaller input sizes are also able to show high speedup at around 7 with 	a small number of processors. Once again, the high initial speedup should be expected as merge sort should be able to easily parallelize the sorting phase when inputs are randomly distributed. However, when the number of 		processors start to grow, synchronization and communication costs increase which are shown in the trend in the graph. After around 100 processors, the speedup drops across all input sizes, with a particularly noticeable 		decrease for smaller inputs, where the speedup falls to around 1.5 or lower as the number of processors continues to increase. Quite similar to the perturbed input, the random input data also experiences significant load 		imbalance during the merging phase where some of the processors end up sitting idle, waiting for others to complete their merges. This could reduce the efficiency thus dropping the speedup. The larger input sizes do 		maintain better speedup than the smaller ones but still does not reflect the ideal condition of being linearly scaling with the increase in processors. This should show the communication bottlenecks which could be present 		in the 	merging phase which becomes more prominent as more processors are involved in merging random data.
<p> </p>
<p>Weak Scaling for 1%Perturbed:</p>
  <p align="left">
  <img width="604" alt="PerturbedWeakScaling" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32679090-4d11-447e-8c61-b437131a653f">
</p>
	This graph is looking at the weak scaling for the input type of 1% Perturbed. We see that there is a spike in time in the smaller number of processors. This could be due to initial overhead when only a few processors are 		used to sort and merge large chunks of data. This could also indicate that the overhead of both communication and task distribution is relatively significant when the problem size and number of processors are small. After 		the initial spike, the time per rank stabilitizes for all input sizes as the number of processors increase. This should indicate that once the system has enough processors to distribute the work efficiently, the execution 		time per process will start to stay constant even as input size and processors increase. This should suggest that there is pretty good weak scaling since the execution time does not really increase as the number of 			processors increase. This could be as this input type does not have much variability with weak scaling once the initial overhead is done. Both the sorting and the merging phases are distributed quite well across the 		processors.
<p> </p>
<p>Weak Scaling for Random:</p>
  <p align="left">
  <img width="604" alt="RandomWeakScaling" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1222bbff-aea5-4adb-b691-86a8a4576027">
</p>
  	This graph is quite similar to the perturbed one, the random input type also has a similar spike when there are few processors being used. This seems to be fairly reasonable as with fewer processors, the communication and 		synchronization overhead should be higher relative to the computational work which should cause that initial spike. After that spike, as the number of processors increase, it seems to be stabilized regardless of the input 		size. This should indicate good weak scaling performance, as the algorithm is able to effectively distribute its workload and handle all the communication overhead with the increase in processors. The random input type does 	not seem to cause an issue for weak scaling, once the number of processors start to increase beyond that initial spike, the time stabilizies which should indicate efficiency.
